			<h3>Social Justice and Marijuana Laws: Major Issues</h3>

			<p id="with-element">Two important issues in the news today are social justice and marijuana usage. It seems like every few days, one of these topics gains national attention. The unfortunate difference in the treatment of people based on race has been visible in many instances. People of color are often treated unfairly in the justice system, being incarcerated at higher rates for similar crimes. They also can be treated with more force when dealing with police. Marijuana usage is another issue that is always on the news and is on ballots seemingly every election. Debates over how dangerous or safe marijuana is have led to states having varying laws on marijuana possession. Many people don’t realize how closely linked these problems can be. Marijuana is yet another example in how the law is applied differently based on skin color. ACLU Data from 2018 shows that racial injustice and marijuana possession arrests are closely linked. Data shows concerning trends between Black and White arrests for the possession of marijuana.

			<h3>Noticeable Problems with Arrest Rates</h3>
			<p>The data set shows that Black arrest rates for marijuana possession are higher than White arrest rates in every state listed, despite no significant difference in marijuana usage between races. Across all of the states in the data set, the average Black arrest rate was nearly four times as high as the White arrest rate. On average, there are 689 Black arrests for marijuana possession per 100k people compared to 174 per 100k for the White arrest rate. Only five states, Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawai’i, and Oregon had a Black arrest rate that wasn’t at least twice as high as the White arrest rate. Some states had staggering contrasts in arrest rates. In Montana and Kentucky, Black people were arrested nearly ten times as often for marijuana possession than White people. The state with the highest Black arrest rate per 100k was West Virginia. West Virginia had a Black arrest rate of 2,516 people per 100k for marijuana possession. Using U.S. Census estimates from 2018, that’s over 2% of the Black population in West Virginia, roughly 1,626 people. With 1 in 50 being arrested for marijuana possession in just one year, these arrests are a big example of social injustice and highly alarming. The gap between rates in different states is concerning as well. 11 states have over 1000 Black arrests for marijuana possession per 100k. Not a single state has 1000 white arrests per 100k. To make matters worse, only Wyoming has a White arrest rate of over 500 people per 100k. This canyon sized gap shows how unfair arrest rates currently are across the country.</p>

			<h3>Social Justice Awareness and the Legality of Marijuana</h3>
			<p id="with-element">With social justice issues gaining more awareness, people have attempted to bring awareness about marijuana possession and its history with race. Marijuana possession is one of the most common causes of arrest in the United States over the last few decades. With the gap in Black and White arrest rates, marijuana possession arrest has been one of the biggest examples of social injustice in America. Advocacy groups have started to bring awareness to concerning statistics. “Enforcing marijuana prohibition results in the arrest of more than 600,000 individuals per year, predominantly people of color and young people. This annual total is far more than the total number of arrestees for all violent crimes combined, including murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault,” according to the group NORML.</p>
			<div id="list">
				<h4>States with the Highest Black to White Arrest Ratio for Marijuana Possession</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Montana: 9.62:1</li>
					<li>Kentucky: 9.36:1</li>
					<li>Illinois: 7.51:1</li>
					<li>West Virginia: 7.31:1</li>
					<li>Iowa: 7.62:1</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p id="with-element">The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws believes that marijuana being illegal causes more trouble as opposed to just legalizing usage. “Marijuana prohibition causes more problems than it solves, and ruins thousands more lives than it supposedly tries to save.” NORML is a part of a growing movement that supports the legalization of marijuana. Progress is being made in the battle for marijuana legalization. Since 2018, 13 states have legalized the use of recreational marijuana. The legal status of recreational marijuana is a common sight on election ballots, with many states including this issue in their elections.</p>
			<p id="with-element">The legalization of marijuana could help eliminate marijuana possession arrests. However, the safety of marijuana is always a concern. Opponents to the legalization of marijuana often try to point out the dangers of usage. There are plenty of questions regarding the effects of marijuana and whether it does more harm or good. Syracuse University Ambulance EMT Jack Qu has seen instances of improper or excessive marijuana usage. Qu has seen marijuana related emergencies and their effects in-person. “In comparison to other drugs, marijuana isn’t as severe” Jack says. Jack says that he deals with marijuana related emergencies once every two weeks. “The worst-case scenario I’ve seen is an anxiety attack.” Despite marijuana usage being far higher than cocaine usage, Jack says that the number of calls with emergencies involving the drugs are similar. The EMT says that there are many drugs out there far more dangerous than marijuana: “I don’t see marijuana as a significant threat, the anxiety attacks can be scary but there’s no concern about death.” Jack works in New York, where the use of recreational marijuana is legal. When asked about his thoughts on marijuana legality based off what he’s seen at work, Qu said that he has no issues with legalization but would advise people to be careful: “Keep an eye on the dosage.” Strong edibles are frequent issues.</p>

			<h3>The Future of the Issue</h3>
			<p>Social justice issues and marijuana legalization will continue to remain big stories for the foreseeable future. More elections will feature votes on marijuana with significant results. With marijuana related offenses resulting in a high number of arrests, typically of people of color, each state’s attitude towards marijuana will have a noticeable impact on social justice. If states keep marijuana possession illegal, major progress must be made in closing the gap between White and Black arrest rates.</p>
